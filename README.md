## Introduction

This repository aims to serve as a reference guide for data scientists and machine learning engineers who use Python in their workflows. It covers the following Python frameworks:

1. **NumPy**: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
2. **Pandas**: Powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
3. **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
4. **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a simple plot using Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 25, 30])
plt.title('Simple Line Plot')
plt.xlabel('X-axis Label')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label')
plt.show()
```
